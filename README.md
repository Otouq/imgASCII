(Be aware, this repository was created time ago as a way to learn how github works and some java coding. It was just a silly test from time ago.)

You can generate cool stuff, cool.
With a super-edgy built in interface and resizable img ascii creator!
yay!

PD. The main Project is ASCII2, and ASCII_TEST is a demostration.
